		<h3>Basketball</h3>
		<p> Ever since I was a child, I've always loved basketball. Whether if it was watching my favorite sports' team <b>The Chicago Bulls</b> on tv, or playing with friends, I just loved the art of basketball. For this reason, I would often convince my mom to put me on Travel Basketball teams, so I can get better at the sport. Today, I am the captain of my intramural basketball, and I continue to love playing the sport of Basketball. </p>

		<h3>Chess</h3>
		<p> During the sophmore year of high school, I would often lose to my best friend who is very skilled at Chess. For this reason, in order to get better, I joined the chess club at my high school. After playing multiple games, I've grown to like playing chess and have improved playing it as well. Today, I often visit my Grandpa to play chess. Even though I rarely win, I enjoy the time I get to spend playing with him. Below, there is a description list of the different chess pieces and their moves. I hope you can learn how to play as well!</p>
