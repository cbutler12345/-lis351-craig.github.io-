		<h1>My Trip to Louisiana in Summer 2022</h1>
<article>
	<h2>Summary</h2>
		<p> In the Summer of 2022, I, along with my grandpa and my mother, took a trip to Baton Rouge, Louisiana to visit my family. During the trip, I had the opportunity to visit my family's restaurant <i>Brown's Cafe</i>, tour LSU's college campus, and meet more members of my family. After a couple days in Baton, Rouge Louisiana, my family and I drove to New Orleans and toured the city. Here, walked down Bourbon Street which is famous for its live music, neon lights and decorative balconies. Furthermore, in New Orleans, I tried Oysters for the first time. Overall, I enjoyed my trip to Louisiana and hope I can go again soon. </p>
